# 3D-Game-of-Life
A Web-Based 3D Implementation of John Conwayâ€™s Game of Life Cellular Automaton (Final Year Project)

This is the git repository for my final year university project. This project aims to create a web-based 3D version of the game of life cellular automaton (https://www.conwaylife.com/)

At the start of the project, I will be learning webpack while developing the core components using JavaScript and three.js for the graphical representation of the game. I created a prototype project for a web-based implementation of the standard game of life (2-dimensional) so a lot of the starting code will be directly from that project.

The master branch will eventually be the most recent stable release build, with the dev branch being stable development builds and any other branches should branch from this dev branch or its children, although due to me being the only developer and the relative simplicity of the development process (very few files, all on one page) there might not be branches off children of dev.

I treat new branches as new features, for example if I wanted to implement the Toastify notifications (like in my 2D project) then I could create a new branch from dev called "notifications" and I will develop that one component only, then merge with dev once completed (and tested, it should not be merged if it does not work!).

Due to personal difficulties IRL, I have started the bulk of the coding for this project later than expected but I am confident that I can now crack on and code the bulk of it soon
