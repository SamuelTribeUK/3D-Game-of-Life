This is the git repository for my final year university project. This project aims to create a web-based 3D version of the game of life cellular automaton (https://www.conwaylife.com/)

Version 1.0 allows users to create custom grid sizes and game speeds, stop and start the game, and step through a single iteration. Notifications are displayed using toastify-js when settings are invalid or if the settings might cause lag.

Version 1.1 added JSON functionality allowing the game grid to be exported to text in the settings panel and custom game states in JSON Array format can be loaded by pasting it in the JSON textarea on the settings panel.

Version 1.2 added Presets and Rules selection boxes (see heading Presets and Rules below for more info).

Version 1.3 added a toggle box to hide dead cells. This can dramatically improve performance if the majority of cells in the game are dead. Also added a basic wireframe box to represent the boundaries of the grid.

Version 1.4 provided a back-end update that moved the live neighbour checking part of the code into a web worker, so it runs on its own thread. This should help with CPU usage with low powered machines and big grid sizes. A modern browser that supports web workers is now required.

Version 1.5 added a glider preset based on a glider shown by Carter Bays in the Complex systems 1 Journal in 1987 (373-400). New rules have also been implemented for this preset, B6/S567. The journal pages by Carter Bays can be found here: https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/01-3-1.pdf

Version 1.6 was a back-end update that added jsdoc comments to every function in the main javascript files used. HTML documentation can be generated by having jsdoc installed (it's currently a dev dependency) and running "jsdoc src/<jsfile.js>" with <jsfile.js> replaced with the filename you want to generate the documentation for.

Version 1.7 provided a back-end update that implemented the Jest testing framework and 10 tests. At the moment, only the workerOnMessage function in game.worker.js is tested. This is to ensure correctness with the algorithm in case of any changes made in the future. 1.7.1 fixed a bug with dead cells not showing after unticking the checkbox.

Version 1.8 added custom rule input in the format Birth:[array of integers] Survive:[array of integers] within their respective text inputs. The only validation that occurs is to ensure the values are numbers and are >= 0. Version 1.8.1 changed the light back to a point light (following the camera), dead cells are hidden by default, and the camera fov has been changed to a more realistic 45 (from 75).

Version 1.9 included a new graph feature and major updates to the dependency package versions, including the removal of the jquery dependency by including the required functions directly within extend.js (As a result, workerFakeDOM.js is no longer required). The new graph feature, which was implemented using the line chart options of [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), adds a dynamic line chart display box to the bottom 20% of the screen which plots the percentage of alive cells per iteration of the game. The main intended use case for the graph feature was to allow analysis on correlations between the chances of long-term survival and the number of alive cells throughout the game. During the testing this new feature, it was evident that the inital randomly-generated game board was limited in that a new game would always start with ~50% of cells alive, resulting in an immediate massacre reducing the alive percentage to low single-digits. A future feature could be to implement customisation to the random starting population board via a percentage setting.

## How to deploy to the webserver

After the new configuration changes and new files added in wip-core-server, the project can now be deployed to a web server. For this project, I am using an IONOS VPS running Ubuntu 20.04, I use Nginx configured to use port 3000 as this is the node application port for my project and it is fully configured with SSL and a domain (gol.samueltribe.com).

When I want to deploy to the server (usually after merging a feature branch with dev or dev with master) I clone the git repo on the webserver, change to the desired branch and use npm install (ensure you have installed node js and npm), then run 'npm run build-production'. This will generate the production build of the project within the dist folder. I have a server.js file using express to use the dist folder for the application and to listen on port 3000 (for Nginx). I then use 'forever' to start server.js forever in the background (helpful when using SSH like me), then try to connect to the website.

Hopefully, if all is completed correctly, you should see the 3D Game of Life webpage!

## Font: Cascadia Code

The preferred font used for the site is Cascadia Code (https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) and is free to use under the SIL Open Font Licence 1.1 (https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL).

## Presets and Rules

As of v 1.5, there are 4 pre-set options:

1. Custom (This is the standard random starting config with dimensions and speed user-specified)
2. Blinker B45/S5 (This was implemented based on http://rbeaulieu.github.io/3DGameOfLife/)
3. Accordion Replicator B45/S5 (This was implemented based on http://rbeaulieu.github.io/3DGameOfLife/)
4. Carter Bays Glider B6/S567 (This was implemented based on "Candidates for the Game of Life in Three Dimensions" by Carter Bays, published in the first edition of the Complex Systems Journal 1987 (373-400))

I want it to be clear that The Blinker and Accordion pre-set configurations were not discovered by me, I found them from Raphael Beaulieu's and Elliot Coy's 3D Game of life linked above. The Carter Bays Glider was implemented based on the journal publication linked above.

## jsdoc

As of v 1.6, jsdoc has been included as a dev dependency and every function in the main js files has been commented so that jsdoc can generate HTML documentation for my code. As described above, the documentation can be generated by using "jsdoc src/<jsfile.js>" in the root directory of the project with <jsfile.js> replaced with the filename of the file to be documented.

## Jest Testing

As of v1.7, Jest has been included as a dev dependency and is configured to be able to test the game.worker.js file. Big thanks to smpeters on GitHub (https://github.com/smpeters) for providing instructions on getting jest working with the style of imports I was using, the full page can be found here: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/9395

Another big thanks to Andrea Stagi for making a package that transforms web workers into the correct format so they can be tested using Jest. I found this at the bottom of the article they wrote here: https://vuedose.tips/how-to-test-web-workers-with-jest/
